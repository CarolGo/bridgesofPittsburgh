I have moved all the files I created in 'data' folder into this 'pgh_road' folder.

- **edges folder**  
This is a file which contains shapefile of old edge data that is downloaded by OSMnx python package.<br>

- **nodes folder**  
This is a file which contains shapefile of old node data that is downloaded by OSMnx python package.<br>

- **edges.ipynb**  
This is a python code file. The code is my first attempt to call OpenStreetMapâ€™s Overpass API by using OSMnx python package. There are two output files. One is 'pgh_road', a folder which contains shapefiles of edges and nodes. The other is 'pgh_road.graphml', which is a graphml file used for Gephi.<br>

- **pgh_road.graphml**  
This is the output file that python code produced. <br>

Here is the link of the OSMnx package I use.  [OSMnx Example](https://github.com/gboeing/osmnx-examples/blob/master/notebooks/01-overview-osmnx.ipynb) <br>
