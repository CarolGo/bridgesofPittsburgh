I have moved all the files I created in '_data_' folder into this '_pgh_road_' folder.

- **edges folder**  
This is a file which contains shapefile of old edge data that is downloaded by OSMnx python package.<br>

- **nodes folder**  
This is a file which contains shapefile of old node data that is downloaded by OSMnx python package.<br>

- **edges.ipynb**  
This is a python code file. The code is my first attempt to call OpenStreetMapâ€™s Overpass API by using OSMnx python package. There are two output files. One is '_pgh_road_', a folder which contains shapefiles of edges and nodes. The other is '_pgh_road.graphml_', which is a graphml file used for Gephi.<br>

- **pgh_road.graphml**  
This is the output file that python code produced. <br>
